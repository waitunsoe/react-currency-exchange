# Currency Converter

1. Firstly, I install `React` with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
2. Then, [MaterialUi](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) is installed for styling and using ready-made components
3. To get currencies, `axios` is installed via npm with this command `npm i axios`
4. For the currencies api, [exchange-api](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) is used which needs to register to access api-key
5. As a final result after 12 hours of coding in one sitting, completed version of this project is hosted with [vercel](https://vercel.com)
